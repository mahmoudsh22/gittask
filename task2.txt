we can use 436 LED
becuase, each LED take 0.1A and total volt wil be 33v and total current =1440/33=43.63
number of led=43.63/0.1=436 LED 









i think we can use lithium-ion because it's weight light and small size and not very expensive 
the total power for motors=4*12*4=192w    and power for camera =0.5*12=6w
total power=198w  and energy=198*0.5=99wh   for safety use battery whith140wh and 12v
     


1- the resistance of 0.5ohm for 3.7v battery not responsble because it is very high and will take high  power from battery
2-we can measure capacity of battery by discharge it while measure 





we have power of any instrument and multiply it with time to get energy in wh
and cost detrmine with pound/wh 
we can reduce it by use instrument with low power
